# The Solutions to Cheating in Zombies

## Preventing Splicing
This is probably one of the longest standing cheating issues in zombies. The only real way to prove that a game is not spliced, is likely going to be each game being verified with an anticheat or some kind of program that constantly monitors a game, with lots of information about the game such as the current round number, when it started/ended, etc. That information should be saved publicly in some way so that the community can go back and tell if a certain game was fully played or not based on the game data collected.

## World at War
A patch needs to be created to force the flashing the patch checksums, or an anticheat program needs to be created.

## Black Ops
The [BO1-AntiCheat](https://github.com/BlackOpsOne/BO1-AntiCheat) project is a great solution for this game, it picks up on everything that is known and is actively updated.

## Black Ops II
I recommend requiring only verified patches to be in the game for each category, and no others (the [patch checksums feature](./definitions/Patch-Checksums.md) will tell you if this is being done or not), along with the latest version of Plutonium. The patches need to force the flashing of the checksums at the start of the game, as well as checking for every Dvar that can be used to cheat.

# What will eventually have to happen
Sometime in the future, the only solution that will work is an actively updated anticheat for each game that is specifically designed to catch everything that is known and also try to prevent other things that people may try to do.

Anything in between now and then are only temporary fixes to the problem.

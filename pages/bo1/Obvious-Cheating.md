# Black Ops - Obvious Cheating

## God Mode
This makes you invincible and unable to take any form of damage. Damage indicators will also not appear.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle god mode with the `god` command.

## Demi God Mode
This works exactly how the normal god mode does, except you will receive the damage indicators.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle demi god mode with the `demigod` command.

## No Target
This toggles all AI targeting of the player.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle no target with the `notarget` command.

> [!CAUTION]
> This affects monkey bombs and the upgraded crossbow, as it will make zombies target the weapon faster.

## Common Zombie Patching
This is referring to modification of `common_zombie_patch.ff`. Once this file is extracted with a certain extractor, the animation for drinking a perk will be reverted to the World at War animation.

> [!CAUTION]
> There are publicly available tools that keep this animation intact once the fastfile is recompiled.

## Map Patching
This refers to modification of any fastfile with the naming scheme `(map_name)_patch.ff`. Once this file is extracted with an extractor, certain sounds when drinking perks will play twice.

> [!WARNING]
> This makes audio for games important.

> [!CAUTION]
> There are publicly available tools that keep the sounds intact once the fastfile is recompiled.

## Game Mod
Game Mod is a mod loader for Black Ops, however heavily abused, and the source code is publicly available.

> [!CAUTION]
> Game Mod modifies the game in such a way that makes the game completely different, even with no mod loaded.
> 
> For example, explosives in certain situations will not damage you where in the base game it would.
> 
> As an example: You can have 4 Gersh Devices or 5 Frag Grenades.

## Missing Starting Cutscene
When you open the the base version of Black Ops, the "Treyarch/Activision presents" cutscene will appear, but on Game Mod this is completely removed.

> [!TIP]
> This can be detected by simply showing the intro cutscene, but would require the full session.

## Mod Loaded Text
When you load a map with a mod loaded, text will appear on the top right, displaying which mod is loaded.

> [!WARNING]
> If the top right is covered, this is a good indicator that they are using Game Mod.

## Missing Hostname
Missing hostname text on the scoreboard (typically `BlackOpsZombie` or `BGamerZombie` depending on how the game is played) indicates the use of Game Mod.

> [!WARNING]
> There are commands to bring this text back.

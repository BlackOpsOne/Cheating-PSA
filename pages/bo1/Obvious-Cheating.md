# Black Ops - Obvious Cheating

## God Mode
This makes you invincible and unable to take any form of damage, and damage indicators will not appear.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle god mode with the `god` command.

## Demi God Mode
This works exactly how the normal god mode does, except you will receive the damage indicators.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle demi god mode with the `demigod` command.

## No Target
This toggles all AI targeting of the player.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle no target with the `notarget` command.

> [!CAUTION]
> This affects monkey bombs and the upgraded crossbow, as it will make zombies target the weapon faster.

## Common Zombie Patching
This is referring to modification of `common_zombie_patch.ff`. Once this file is extracted with a certain extractor, the animation for drinking a perk will be reverted to the World at War animation.

> [!CAUTION]
> There are extractors exist that keep this animation intact, and are publicly available, just because an animation is normal does not mean this file is unmodified.
>
> It is also important to note that `.ff` files can be swapped between map restarts, showing the `zone` folder does absolutely nothing.

## Map Patching
This refers to modification of any fastfile with the naming scheme `(map_name)_patch.ff`. Once this file is extracted with an extractor, certain sounds when drinking perks will play twice.

> [!WARNING]
> This makes audio for games important.

## Game Mod
Game Mod is a mod loader for Black Ops, however heavily abused.

> [!CAUTION]
> This completely modifies the game in ways that make it not vanilla.
> 
> As an example: You can have 4 Gersh Devices or 5 Frag Grenades.

## Missing Hostname
Missing hostname text on the scoreboard (typically `BlackOpsZombie` or `BGamerZombie` depending on how the game is played) indicates the use of Game Mod.

> [!WARNING]
> There are commands to bring this text back.

# Black Ops III - Stealth Cheating

## Dvars/Commands
Since there are so many for this game, [I have put together an individual list of them here](./Dvars-And-Commands.md).

## GSC Injection
Players can use programs to inject GSC scripts at any point during a game.

GSC scripts can modify basically anything on the map.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is completely undetectable without a program specifically searching for it.

## Modification of Verified Patches/Mods
Verified mods such as [oJumpy's Ascendance Aesthetic Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3000417367), can be modified with tools in multiple ways that would make it impossible to tell.

> [!CAUTION]
> The mod fastfiles can be extracted and recompiled, or a totally new fastfile can be compiled using the original. It depends on the tool being used to modify the mod.
>
> This is completely undetectable without a program specifically scanning these files.

## Modification of Scripts
Any scripts that are allowed can be modified by decompiling them and recompiling them, there are tools that exist for this.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is completely undetectable without a program specifically scanning these files.

## Modification of BOIII
The BOIII client for Black Ops 3 is meant to provide a safe way to play the game. However since this client is open source, it can be modified to perform engine level modification.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is completely undetectable without a program specifically searching for it.

## Seeded RNG Mod
There exists a mod for setting a specific rng seed, this mod allows you to modify your RNG in basically every way you can think of. Since all the random aspects is based on the same seed, you will get the same rng every single time, this includes but is not limited to zombie spawns, mystery box luck, etc.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is completely undetectable without a program specifically searching for it.

## Dvar/Command Writing
This refers to the use of external programs to write to the command buffer, to either set a certain dvar or run a certain command.

> [!CAUTION]
> The only way to detect this is via an external program checking the game's memory.

## Custom Game Executables
The game executable itself can be modified to gain an advantage.

> [!CAUTION]
> This can lead to a multitude of changes that are not possible via a patch.
> The only way to detect this is via an external program checking all relevant game functions.

## Console Stealth Patching
Console (PS4/Xbox) can have stealth patches via GSC mods to have something that would provide an advantage, such as a better setup.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is impossible to detect, as console can not have a reliable anticheat.

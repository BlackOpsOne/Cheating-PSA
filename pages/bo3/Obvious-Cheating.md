# Black Ops III - Obvious Cheating

## God Mode
This makes you invincible and unable to take any form of damage. Damage indicators will also not appear.

> [!WARNING]
> This is locked behind cheat protection, however the protection can be removed with external programs.

## Script Injection on oJumpy Mods
oJumpy has implemented a sort of indicator for GSC script injection within his mods. Upon injection, it will display on the screen that a script was injected.

> [!WARNING]
> In an unmodified state, the game is protected against injection on one front, however there are many more that are not covered.

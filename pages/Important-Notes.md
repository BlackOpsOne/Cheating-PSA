# Important Notes
This page contains bits of information that are relevant to the topic.

## What can be changed with a patch/mod/script?
Pretty much anything, you can modify your box luck, or go even further and modify the zombie spawns and change how often they come out of certain places, a player's mind is the limit.

> [!CAUTION]
> Showing what you have in the folders that these reside in does not do anything to prove that you do not have modified or extra files, you can swap files out and place new ones after showing what is there, especially with the rise of programs that place patches in the zone folder.

## Cheat Engine
Cheat Engine is a tool that allows you to debug a game's memory.

With it you can extract information from the game, such as the next special round, you can also change those values with this tool.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is undetectable without the use of a third party program searching for it. You could also protect the game's memory externally, but that could potentially cause issues for any community made tools.

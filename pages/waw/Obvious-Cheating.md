# World at War - Obvious Cheating

## God Mode
This makes you invincible and unable to take any form of damage, and damage indicators will not appear.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle god mode with the `god` command.

## Demi God Mode
This works exactly how the normal god mode does, except you will receive the damage indicators.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle demi god mode with the `demigod` command.

## No Target
This toggles the targeting of zombies to a player.

> [!TIP]
> You can toggle demi god mode with the `notarget` command.

> [!CAUTION]
> This affects monkey bombs, as it will make zombies target them faster.

## Mods
The ingame mod system transfers certain aspects of custom maps to normal zombies maps.

> [!CAUTION]
> While obvious on some stuff, this can easily be abused to become a form of stealth cheating.

# Definitions - Fastfiles
Fastfiles are a specially compressed file that most older Call of Duty titles use to contain some of the following (not everything is mentioned due to irrelevance):

- Models - Determines weapon shapes, map objects, etc.

- GSC Scripts - The actual code of the game and controls how each map functions.

- Weapon Files - Determines how a weapon works in terms of damage and ammo.

There are many tools that exist for decompressing and recompressing these files, some break certain game assets, which is why some modified fastfiles will have either a broken perk animation, or sound doubling.

Some tools do not have this problem at all, such as [OpenAssetTools](https://openassettools.dev), which allows you to create new fastfiles based on any original game file, avoiding broken assets.

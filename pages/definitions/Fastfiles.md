# Definitions - Fastfiles
Fastfiles are a special compressed file that most older Call of Duty titles use to contain some of the following (not everything is mentioned due to irrelevance):

- Models (determines the shape weapons and map objects)

- Scripts, these are the actual code of the game, depending on the game, they will be either pre-compiled, or will be the original files from the developers for older games such as World at War.

- Weapon Files, these determine how any weapon works in terms of damage and ammo.

There are many tools that exist for decompressing and recompressing these files, some are not perfect and make it obvious to tell if you have, however there are a few that make editing these impossible to tell.

# Definitions - Plutonium Checksums

On Plutonium r4516 and above, there are two new features:

- `cg_flashScriptHashes`, once set to `1`, this will flash unique checksums of each GSC script/patch loaded. On BO1, this will display specifically modified files, including ones from fastfiles.
- `cg_drawChecksums`, once set to `1`, this will display checksums of your current game on the top right, this takes everything loaded into account when calculated, these checksums are specific to the files loaded, and will change upon different patches/scripts being loaded.

These two features are specifically important in verifying that games are using the right fastfiles or community patches.

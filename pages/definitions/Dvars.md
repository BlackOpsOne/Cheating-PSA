# Definitions - Dvars
A Dvar is a variable (or command) that has a value attached to it. These are `100%` able to be edited by any player, at any time. 

Some ways a player may edit a Dvar:
- Entering `/dvar_name dvar_value` into the console. This is easily seen.

- A simple config bind: `bind G dvar_name "dvar_value"`. This is impossible to know if used and does not bring up the console on screen.

- Using an external tool to write to the command buffer. This is impossible to know if used and does not bring up the console on screen.
  - There are multiple public tools that do this for a few Call of Duty titles.

External programs exist to edit these variables for many titles such as Black Ops.
